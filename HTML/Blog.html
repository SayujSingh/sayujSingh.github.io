				<p><br>Our life has been slowly taken over by technology. Technology has taken an integral part in our life, it has been a status symbol for people for living a modern life. Without the invention of science and technology our life would have to face various difficulty in doing different work which are very easy compared to our past. <br></p>
				
				<p><br>Life wouldn’t have been the same if there wasn’t a rapid growth in development of Science and Technology. It has affected Food, Entertainment, Finance, and many more industries which plays vital role to maintain quality life of people.<br></p>
				<p><br>Technology has helped me to grow, it has helped me to learn and to continue learning. In fact, through the use of technology, it has given me knowledge about programming and web development. Whenever I got stuck on problems internet has provided me with the knowledge for solving it.
				<P><br>It has created a social platform in which people can share their knowledge between millions of people within seconds. It has made keeping long distance relationship very easy which has improved the social life of the people. Communicating with friends and family has been very easy due to the use of technology. <br></p>
				<p><br>Searching for information is a lot quicker and more useful, but on the flip side there is so much opinion out there that real news can get lost due to fake news, opinion. It’s has made video games much more fun, when you can interact with people all over the globe in MMOs and allows co-op mode on a remote server without having to host on your own equipment.<br></p>
				<p><br>Without technology our life would be bland and I would not have been able to do all the that I have just told. <br></p>
